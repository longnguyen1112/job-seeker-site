# Job Seeker Full-Stack Website

This is a semester long class project. I was working in a group of 2. This website is a job seeker website which has 3 types of users (JOB SEEKER, EMPLOYER and ADMIN).
ADMIN is able to register a company and assign the employer of the company based on the data in database. EMPLOYER has 2 function which is posting a new job and check all the applicants. EMPLOYER and ADMIN are only created manually in the database. You can only sign up as a JOB SEEKER. After signing up, JOB SEEKER can log in and look for a job being posted in the database with some functions (search by keyword,sort jobs by salary, alphabetically,etc.). 

The website runs on WAMP server
